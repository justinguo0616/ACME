Some Invariants of this system can be defined as follows:

* The ACME Run can assume trails available on the app will be curated by local authorities, ensuring the safety of the user while running on the trail. 

* The ACME Run can assume that McMaster University will be responsible for their own version of the app MacRun, administrating safe trails and shelter locations.

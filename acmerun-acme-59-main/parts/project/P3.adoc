*MVP Justification:* The first sprint of our development produces a minimal viable product that provides the mimum feature set that allows for core functionality.
Within a month we are able to set up the core systems of the app through the mapping API alongside user tracking. These core requirements paired with basic game logic fulfills the target basic functionality of an interactive workout app.
It also allows the development to collect feedback on the logistics of the core functionality and how the map and live location features interact with the system.

Security concerns were taken into strong consideration when determining the priority of requirements. The app involves users creating a personal profile and creating a password, along with personal information such as their name, age, height, weight, and other health information. This can be considered sensitive and personal for users, and it is very important that the privacy and safety of this information is at the top of the priority list to ensure that people cannot gain unauthorized access to the information of other users, and this must be refleced at the implementation level of the app's features.

The prioritization of requirements focused on how important a requirement was for the main functionality and benefits of the app, as well as the safety and security of users. The main functionality of the app refers to requirements which directly influence how users will interact with the app on a daily basis, which involves the main features such as completing a workout, participating in events, and having a personalized experience. So, features that have a large part in optimizing the users experience in these aspects such as providing event information and workout options, and a personal profile were deemed to be must have requirements. Other requirements which provided additional benefits that would greatly improve the users experience while using the app were deemed to be requirements we should have. And other requirements that also provided some aspects that were nice to have for ease of use but were not essential for the functionality and goal of the app were deemed as could have or will not have.

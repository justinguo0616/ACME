TIP: _New processes, or improvement to existing processes, made possible by the project’s results. It presents the business benefits expected from the successful execution of the project. **This chapter is the core of the Goals book**, describing what the organization expects from the system. It ensures that the project remains focused: if at some stage it gets pushed in different directions, with “creeping featurism” threatening its integrity, a reminder about the original business goals stated in those chapters will help._  <<BM22>>

This app's expected benefits are mainly assisting individuals wishing to stay healthy. Many people desire to become more fit or to lose weight by working out, however going to the gym might not be the best option for everyone. There are many issues with gym subscriptions, where subscriptions can become quite costly, especially when including access to personalized training programs. Countless people might not have the time or means to travel to the gym, others might not enjoy the repetitive workouts in the same unchanging environment but still have the desire to stay fit. Thus, the largest benefit of this app is the ability for the users to exercise at their own time and at their own rate without having to worry about the costs and time commitments of going to the gym. 
Users are able to run on trails that have been curated by local authorities that ensure the safety of the user when running. While the user is running, they might be attacked by virtual enemies that have multiple ways to be defeated, giving the user several options for different exercises to complete in order to continue on the trail. In turn, these events will assist the app in determining the best possible timing for events and the intensity of the exercise along with the ability to connect a heart rate monitor, personalizes the app for each individual user. Special events happen during certain periods of the year, such as Halloween and during the summer, where there will be more challenges to complete and keep the users engaged, helping them stay fit and reach their goals. This is also enabled by the pilot app MacRun which will be deployed on the McMaster University campus and surrounding areas (a corridor between the bayfront on the lake and the Dundas Valley Conservation Area).

The goals that present these benefits, as well as the stakeholders that they affect can be seen in this goal model diagram:
